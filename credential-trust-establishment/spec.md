## Introduction

Once you can create a trust list using [Trust Establishment](https://identity.foundation/trust-establishment/) , it is useful to extend Trust Establishment by defining roles and linking them to credentials for situations where:

1. Enumerating every trusted ecosystem participant in a governance file is not practical (or, in some cases, not possible).
2. It may be desirable to verify a participant's trusted status via a trust list entry AND/OR a credential.

Some of the most important roles are those tied to the issuing and/or verifying of credentials, so it is also necessary to tie roles to credential schemas.

Collecting all of this information in one place for ecosystem participants to access is powerful and convenient. A governance file is one relatively simple method for delivering trust establishment information.

The following sections cover what is required to enable Credential Trust Establishment:

- Schemas
- Roles
- Linking Participants to Roles
- Governance File Metadata

## Participant Expectations

This data model is the expression about trust from the publisher, who signs the document. Any information in the document is assumed to be the carefully selected choices of the publisher, including any schemas, participants, and linked governance files. Publishing the file itself places no requirement on any other participant to read or respect the opinions of the file.

The Governance File is read by ecosystem participants to understand the opinion of the publisher. Compliance with the format places no requirement for participants to respect or follow the same opinions. Participants may also choose to respect only a portion of the published governance. Ecosystem factors outside the scope of this format may influence participant behavior.

## Schemas

The schemas section of the format specifies the schemas used in an ecosystem. Each list item describes a single schema.

Each schema is described with the following attributes:

- **id**: the identifier of the schema. This identifier must be URI that links to the schema definition. This identifier is used to refer to this schema elsewhere in the data model. This identifier is not intended to be visible during normal use.
- **name**: The human readable name for this credential. This name should be used to refer to this credential in any user interfaces.

Here is an example for a U.S.-based higher education ecosystem:

```json
...
	"schemas": [
		{
			"id": "uri:example:PdiVKGAjdiVKGAjLqtTroc:2:Accrediting_Body:1.0",
			"name": "Accrediting Body",
		},
		{
			"id": "uri:example:BXtzYPyPdiVKGAjLqtPexs:2:University_Degree_Issuer:1.0",
			"name": "University Degree Issuer",
		},
		{
			"id": "uri:example:QHqtjywxfZ3yYsFrRHFLQm:2:Bachelors_Degree:1.0",
			"name": "Bachelors Degree",
		},
		{
			"id": "uri:example:JAjLqtPexs3yYsFrRHFLQm:2:Student_ID:1.0",
			"name": "Student ID",
		}
	],
...
```

## Roles

Roles define the different types of activities that are present in the ecosystem.

Each role is represented in a struct, where the key is the name of the role, and the value is a struct with values defining the role. The name of the role is not intended to be displayed, but used as a reference elsewhere in the data structure. Any names may be chosen for the convenience of governance maintanance. The role name must consist of alphanumeric characters, dashes, and underscores.

Roles are described with the following attributes:

- **issue**: This is the list of the Schema IDs that this role is authorized to issue. The Schemas MUST be present in the schema section of the document.
- **verify**: This is the list of the Schema IDs that this role is authorized to verify. The Schemas MUST be present in the schema section of the document.
- **granted_by**: This, if present, specifies the Schema ID that, upon presentation, qualifies the subject to have this role. Any Schema specified here MUST be defined in the Schemas section of the document and aproved verifiers specified via a role defined in the Roles section.

Roles may omit any attributes that do not apply.

This example shows potential roles used in a univeristy diploma ecosystem application.

```json
...
	"roles": {
		"accrediting_authorizer": {
			"issue": [
				"uri:example:PdiVKGAjdiVKGAjLqtTroc:2:Accrediting_Body:1.0"
			]
		},
		"university_accreditor": {
			"issue": [
				"uri:example:BXtzYPyPdiVKGAjLqtPexs:2:University_Degree_Issuer:1.0"
			],
			"granted_by": "uri:example:PdiVKGAjdiVKGAjLqtTroc:2:Accrediting_Body:1.0"
		},
		"verify_student_id": {
			"verify": [
				"uri:example:JAjLqtPexs3yYsFrRHFLQm:2:Student_ID:1.0"
			],
			"granted_by": "uri:example:BXtzYPyPdiVKGAjLqtPexs:2:University_Degree_Issuer:1.0"
		},
		"issue_bachelors_degree": {
			"issue": [
				"uri:example:Lor8tASDc74EA268Jvc8J2:2:Bachelors_Degree:1.0"
			],
			"granted_by": "uri:example:BXtzYPyPdiVKGAjLqtPexs:2:University_Degree_Issuer:1.0"
		},
	}
...
```

## Linking Participants to Roles

Once schemas are listed and roles are described, they need to be linked to the trusted participants. This is done by adding a new section to the Trust Establishment section of the document.

The new section contains the enumerated sections of roles for a participant, along with the time range the role applies.

**start**: REQUIRED. The ISO 8601 encoded date and time of when the role was assigned to the participant.
**end**: OPTIONAL. The ISO 8601 encoded date and time of when the role was removed from the participant. This should not be present if the end date is not known.
**role**: REQUIRED. The name of the role, used within the roles section of this document.

```json
...
			"https://example.com/roles.schema.json": {
				"did:example:usdepartmentofeducation": {
					"roles": [
						{
							"start": "2023-02-25 00:00:00Z",
							"role": "accrediting_authorizer"
						}
					]
				},
				"did:example:nwccu": {
					"roles": [
						{
							"start": "2023-02-25 00:00:00Z",
							"role": "university_accreditor"
						}
					]
				},
				"did:example:faberuniversity": {
					"roles": [
						{
							"start": "2023-02-25 00:00:00Z",
							"role": "verify_student_id"
						},{
							"start": "2020-01-01 00:00:00Z",
							"end": "2021-01-01 00:00:00Z",
							"role": "issue_bachelors_degree"
						},{
							"start": "2022-01-01 00:00:00Z",
							"role": "issue_bachelors_degree"
						}
					]
				}
			}
...
```

## Governance File Metadata

As with Trust Establishment, it makes sense to add some meta data to the governance file to assist those who are using the file. See (Linked Governance)[#]

The full University Diploma example used in this document is included as the first sample listed in the Appendix.

**name**: REQUIRED. User oriented title of this document.

**description**: OPTIONAL. User oriented description of this document. Usually a more informative description than the name alone.

**version**: REQUIRED. Version string of this document. Must follow SemVer OR be lexographicly increasing version strings.

**format**: REQUIRED. Version of this data type. Current version is "1.0"

**last_updated**: REQUIRED. ISO 8601 string when this document was published.

**author**: REQUIRED. DID of the party publishing this document.

**docs_uri**: OPTIONAL. URI for human-oriented documentation for this governance.

**ttl**: OPTIONAL. Expected length of time this version of the document is expected to be valid. This suggests to consumers of this document the interval at which it should be checked for updates.

**trusted_governance** (optional): Contains a list of publisher DIDs and document URIs for goverance files trusted by the author of THIS governance file. Upon retrieval, the document must be signed by the stated publisher to be considered valid.
TODO: Include a note about how to link to a specific version / general version of governance file when versioning is added.

  "trusted_governance": [
    {
      "publisher": "did:example:publisher",
      "uri": "https://example.com/other/trusted/goveranance"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Linked Goverance

Linked governance files provide a flexible mechanism for governing larger ecosystems. Higher authorities can bundle governance together. Lower authorities can reference higher authorities. The result is a straightforward mecanism for practical ecosystem governance.

Linked governance allows for governance chains to exist - the inclusion of an external governance file allows that governance to itself reference other governance files. While in theory this allows for infiniately long chains, in practice the requirement for the publisher to trust linked files places a reasonable limit. Also see (Expectations)[#expectations] for further commentary on the responsiblities of the publisher and reader.

### Versioning

Versioning is a way to allow users of decentralized ecosystem governance to track/use the current version of published governance or track/use older version of the file. This allowes flexibility of using/tracking most current version of DEGov file at any time.

The version number of the current file is represented as an integer. For maintaining a straightforward and sequential version history, it is advised to increment each new published version of the file by 1. This approach guarantees an orderly progression. However, it's permissible to skip version numbers as long as each subsequent version has a number greater than the previous one. Example:

```json
{
  "version": 1
}
```

The "current_version" field contains a URL pointing to the most recently published file. The specific file name at this location is determined based on the current implementation. Example:

```json
{
  "current_version": "https://example.com/path/to/cte/1.json"
}
```

The base uri can point to a file with any file name of your choice as long as this is consistent within the ecosystem you are working with. Example:

```json
{
  "uri": "https://example.com/path/to/cte/file.json"
}
```

Previous versions is an array of objects represented by the version and uri pointing to the unique location of previously published file. Example:

```json
{
  "current_version": "https://example.com/path/to/cte/2.json",
  "previous_versions": [
    {
      "version": 1,
      "uri": "https://example.com/path/to/cte/1.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

Full example:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "uri": "https://example.com/path/to/cte/file.json",
  "current_version": "https://example.com/path/to/cte/2.json",
  "previous_versions": [
    {
      "version": 1,
      "uri": "https://example.com/path/to/cte/1.json"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Appendix

Below are three examples of governance files which include sections for schemas, trust establishment lists, roles, and governance file meta data.

### University Diploma Example

The granting and recognition of university diplomas involve a large number of organizations at various tiers.

Fundamentally, the U.S. Department of Education authorizes organizations to be accrediting bodies.
These accrediting bodies review universities and their programs and state whether they are accredited or not.
In turn, accredited universities grant diplomas to their students that are recognized by various companies, organizations, etc.

This governance file includes schemas for accrediting organization, university, and diploma credentials. The role required to issue these credentials is included in the schema metadata.

A sample participant of each type is included in the "participants" section.

The governance below includes roles for the U.S. Department of Education, the accrediting bodies, and universities.
The U.S. Department of Education is granted the role of "accrediting_authorizer" directly in the governance file in the "participants" section.
Accrediting organizations can be granted the role of "university_accreditor" in the file or via the credential indicated by schema ID in the roles section.
Universities can also be granted the role of "verify_student_id" and "issue_bachelors_degree" in the file or via the credential indicated by schema ID in the roles section.
Finally, universities verify student IDs and issue degrees (such as a bachelors degree) to students (holders).

### DIF Membership Example

The DIF regulates which organizations and individuals can be members and participate in DIF activities. Their governance is relatively
simple but could unlock a lot of powerful interactions via named and/or credentialed participants.

There are two schemas involved--one for authorizing individuals and one for authorizing issuers of the individual credentials.

There are three tiers of participants:

1. The DIF which runs the ecosystem and authorizes other parties
2. Member organizations which authorize individuals to represent them
3. Individuals who receive a membership credential from either the organization they represent or from the DIF directly.

The DIF is a single participant and is only included in the governance file. The organization tier can be authorized via explicitly
listed participantes or via a DIF Member Organization credential. Individuals could be listed but are likely to be authorized via
credentials only.

The governance file lists three roles: one for the DIF itself, one for organizations, and one for individuals.

### Aries Email Ecosystem Example

The Aries community shares code, demos, and examples to promote interoperability and community education.
The Aries community could create a simple demo that shows how agents, credential issuance and verification, and basic governance work in a simple
email-based ecosystem.

There are two schemas used--one for an individual's email credential and one for authorizing issuers of the email credentials.

There are three tiers of participants:

1. The Aries Working Group which runs the ecosystem and authorizes other parties
2. Issuers (organizations or individuals) which wish to support the demo ecosystem by issuing and/or verifying email credentials
3. Individuals who receive an email credential from an authorized email issuer and verify with whomever they choose to present the credential to

The Aries Working Group (AWG) is a single participant and is only included in the governance file. The email issuer tier can be authorized via explicitly
listed participantes or via an Email Issuer credential. Individuals could be listed but are likely to participate via credentials only.

The governance file lists three roles: one for the AWG itself, one for issuers, and one for individuals.
